### **Introduction** {data-width=400}

<!-- note 4-hash header is within the box -->
#### Motivation
1. Few studies have evaluated the translation and implementation of evidence-based aphasia interventions to clinical practice.
2. Dosage may be especially challenging to translate from clinical research to clinical practice settings.
3. Dosage may be reduced in clinical practice due to pragmatic constraints on access to care.
4. A dosage mismatch between research and clinical practice threatens the external validity of treatment research & risks attenuating intervention effectiveness

#### Research Questions
1. What is the typical treatment dose in an episode of care in outpatient rehabilitation clinical settings?
2. What is the typical treatment dose in contemporary clinical aphasia studies?
3. Is the dosage in research well-calibrated to current outpatient clinical practice?

### **Comparing dosage between clinical practice and research** {data-width=700}

<!-- This is one way to put an image in, if it's pre-rendered. You can also render images easily in r-chunks. the shiny package will come in handy, even though we're not rendering a shiny app.  -->

<!-- third panel -->
### **Data and Methods** {data-width=400}

#### Clinical Dosage
- Clinical treatment dosage estimated via utilization-billing data extracted from the Centers for Rehabilitation Services (CRS).
- Inclusion: Patients receiving an evaluation (CPT: 92523, 96105) and treatment (92507) from an SLP from 2014-2019 with an ICD 9/10 diagnosis of aphasia and stroke.

#### Research Dosage
- Scoping review of prospective, behavioral treatment studies from 2009-2019
- Extracted dosage variables and estimated additional non-reported variables if possible
- Reliability (% agreement) for article inclusion/exclusion and data extraction >90%

#### Analysis
- Permutation tests and descriptive statistics were utilized to compare dosage variables

```{r, message=F}
df <- read_csv("stats.csv")
colnames(df) = c("Variable", "Median difference", "p-value")
kableExtra::kbl(df) %>%

```

### Conclusion {data-width=30}

::: {.padtop style="padding-top:10px;"}
- Meaningful dosage gap, especially total hours & weekly intensity. 
- Thre threat to thernal validity of treatment research; potential for an attenuation of intervention effectiveness in outpatient settings. 
- Future research should take steps to facilitate intervention implementation, particularly with regard to dosage. 
- Advocacy and alternative delivery methods are necessary to support treatments with higher dosage.
