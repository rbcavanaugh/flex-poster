\title{Render a poster into a printable image}
\usage{
render_poster_image(
  input,
  output_file = paste0(tools::file_path_sans_ext(input), ".png"),
  width = 1600,
  aspect_ratio = 3/4,
  height = floor(width * aspect_ratio),
  poster_width = 800,
  dpi = 300,
  delay = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Input file (an html generated with \code{\link{flex_dashboard_poster}}).}

\item{output_file}{Output file. Defaults to the same name that the input file,
but uses the png extension.}

\item{width}{Width, in pixels, for the viewport
(see \code{\link[webshot]{webshot}}). This will impact the size of elements
relative to the page.}

\item{aspect_ratio}{Aspect ratio between the height and the width of the
viewport. The poster orientation will depend on this ratio; if it is
> 1 the orientation is portrait (height > width), and if it is < 1 the
orientation is landscape (width > height)}

\item{height}{Calculated using as \code{width * aspect_ratio}, rounded down.}

\item{poster_width}{Intended physical width of the printed poster, in mm.
Defaults to the width of an A1 sheet with portrait orientation.
This will not impact the size of the elements to the page, but the
number of pixels covered per element.}

\item{dpi}{Intended print resolution, in dpi. Used to calculate the zoom
factor necessary to produce enough pixels for a \code{poster_width} print
with the intended resolution.}

\item{delay}{Time in seconds for phantomJS to wait while the page loads
before taking the snapshot.}

\item{...}{Ignored}
}
\value{
Silently returns the path of the rendered image.
}
\description{
`render()` will generate an image with enough resolution to print a poster
with standard ISO 216 A1 dimensions.
}
\note{
Currently the dimensions and other parameters can be changed manually,
but a mechanism to select different dimension templates with appropriate
resolution and zoom for common paper sizes will be implemented.

Documents with dimensions in the ISO A series can be scaled to other sizes
in the series, with corresponding decrease in resolution when upscaling or
increase in resolution when downscaling.

# generate a simple poster from the provided template

# render the html output
rmarkdown::render(input = "my_poster/my_poster.Rmd")
# render the png poster
